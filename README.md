# Carmouche Jewelers

Client was unsatisfied by prior service from competetor. Looking to improve design. No longer wants e-commernce due to lack of e-sales. Wants an updated layout and the ability to display products. Design philosophy is to develop e-commerce but not intergrate it functionally unless the client ever changes their mind. Personally thinking to just have the same layout, but minor adjustments to the backend if the customer or I ever want to update it later or another coder works on the project in the future (easier for everyone involved). Using a previous project as a template/skeleton to build off of for time constraints.

Still a lot of work to go, pulled from previous projects to meet time constraints. Also doing the UI/UX and Graphic Arts myself... Client decided against going with e-commerce, still developed in mind incase they ever change there mind. Still a lot of work to go, should be good enough to let them view.

Minor CSS and mobile compatiablity issues. Used bootstrap for temp trouble shooting. Lots of console logs... Still a lot of clean up needs to be done. Functional and pretty though (the site, my code is ugly). Might add a loading logo to home since there's so many mp4's on launch.
